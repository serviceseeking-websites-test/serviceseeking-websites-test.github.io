“Our house was challenging to start with. The whole interior of the house
was painted in blue and black. It had cobalt blue ceilings, black skirting
boards, dark sky blue walls and black architraves and not to mention that
the doors were all black as well. Glen rose to the challenge and did a
great job of turning it to bright and cheery house. He is professional,
reliable and trustworthy. Very considerate when we had to move into the
house earlier than expected – was able to use half of the house while rest
of the house gets painted. He is neat and tidy – always cleaned up after
each day. I would definitely recommend him to all my friends and family.”

External Feedback from Elizabeth </p>
<blockquote>
"I requested a painter for all internal walls and ceilings at a rental
property in Acacia Ridge. I was contacted by Glen very shortly afterwards
and we agreed on a time to meet at the job site.

Glen was on time and professional. He was able to give me an estimate there
and then. He was able to answer my questions and give me confidence that he
would do what he said he would do. Glen followed up with a written quote
that matched his verbal estimate and then started on the job when he said
he would. His workmanship is great and his actions matched all his words.
The job was finished on time and I am entirely satisfied."

" Great speedy service. Did a thorough job and some extra work for painting our bedroom and bathroom just before Xmas! Would definitely hire Glen again. Thanks "
</blockquote>

<p class="c1">
Annette from Bardon, QLD </p>

<blockquote>
" Glen painted our entire downstairs and a few areas upstairs for us. He was always on time, friendly and certainly went the extra mile. When some of our ceiling didn't look the way he expected (through no fault of his own) he pointed it out to us and gave us options on how to improve the look instead of just leaving us to find it after he had left. Glen was finished in the timeframe that he had estimated and even worked longer hours to ensure this was the case. All in all Glen did a fantastic job and we would certainly hire him again "

<p>Holly, Taringa, Brisbane</p>
<blockquote>"Glen did a wonderful job painting the exterior of our house. He and his team were very thorough, punctual and professional. The best part of working with Glen is his lovely easy going personality:we were running two big reno projects simultaneously and he had to fit in around our backyard concreting job. Needless to say that we were getting quite stressed at times. But Glen was so flexible and accommodating that he was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I would highly recommend Glen!"</blockquote>
<p>Raisa, Kenmore, Brisbane</p>

Very clean and considerate - we were able to use our kitchen each night during the 3 day process."</blockquote>
<p>Jen, Red Hill, Brisbane</p>
<blockquote>"Job done properly."</blockquote>
<p>Guy, Taringa, Brisbane</p>
<blockquote>"Glen and his assistants from G.A. Decorators have just painted some fences and steel posts for me. They took great care not to disturb the shrubs along the fence or to get any paint into the next door yard. Because they put a satin finish on the final coat it is very easy to hose down and clean the fence when necessary. I was very happy with their work."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Glen was always prompt in responding to my requests and queries and was flexible in arranging suitable times to do the job on short notice. The job was well done in an efficient, professional and friendly manner. On a side, it was the first time I had hired a professional painter and would recommend other newbies to learn the difference between woodwork such as architraves and skirting boards and walls and ceilings so they can clearly define what they want done."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thank you Glen for your prompt and professional service! Your rapid response to our request helped greatly. We will definitely recommend your service to our family, friends and community".</blockquote>
<p>Adam and Jo, Springfield, QLD</p>
<blockquote>"When looking for a painter to do the small job I required, I found it very hard to find a reliable painter just to come out and quote. I had many painters from my local area just not show up when they booked in an appointment time for my quote and/or they would call me and reschedule the time. This became an ongoing battle, and I started to think I am probably going to have to paint these walls myself… Well that was until I found Glen. Glen won me from the start with his professionalism and punctuality right from his quotation through to the finished product. Glen listened to what I wanted, gave me advice on colour schemes and also gave me the time to choose the perfect colour paint right up until the night before the job. Glen always painted with a smile and you can’t help but warm to his cheery personality. Glen took pride in my job (even though it was a small job) making sure that every detail was perfect before he left. I would not hesitate to recommend Glen to all of my friends and family, and I will be using him for all my future paint jobs, as my feature walls look spectacular!"</blockquote>
