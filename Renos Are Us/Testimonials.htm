<p>"Tony was the first person to contact us and what I really appreciated from the get go was how many questions he asked to understand the job properly, and that he took the time to explain what really needed doing so I understood. When he got to the job Tony was on it right away, not only did he fix all the cracks in the home but he replastered the cornices and refixed them to the ceiling. He also noticed that our ceilings were sagging and fixed that up for no extra cost. He kept in touch along the whole process so we knew where we were at at all times. Not only can he plaster but also paint, a real handyman who delivers on promises the home looks brand new and at such a cheap price. He then installed insulation In our ceiling again at a reasonable priced and he finished the job on time so we could move ahead with getting furniture in. I'll be keeping his card forever and cannot recommend him highly enough. Worked tirelessly to get the job done on time for us on time and very respectful in mannerisms. If you give him a go an hire him you won't regret it."</p></div></div></div><div class="row-fluid"><div class="span12"><div class="rich-text testi"><div><blockquote>Michelle from Elizabeth Vale, SA</blockquote>
